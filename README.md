# Python-Ray-Tracing
Ray tracing program created in python, no external libraries only pygame to display the output pixels and math to do certain operations

---

## This Ray Tracer can do the following:
 - Spheres and planes (More complex shapes to come)
 - Diffuse shading and object shading
 - SSAA (Super Sampling Anti Aliasing)

Most noticeable on the reflections of the floor in the spheres
